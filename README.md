## ðŸ“– About

This is a project for an Agency Travel Website.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

 - How to integrate with google maps
 - The site contact section uses a map to show the address, for that we used google maps integration and documentation.
 - Media queries
 ** All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops. **

## ðŸš€ Technologies:
